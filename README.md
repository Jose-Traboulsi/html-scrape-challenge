# html-scrape-challenge'

For this challenge, I largely referenced class materials. I also worked with a tutor to get some clarity around plotting. In particular, one point I struggled with
was being able to plot the sorted bar charts. My tutor walked me through this, so you'll see two versions on how to do this: using .plot and using .plt by converting the months (x-axis) back into strings.
